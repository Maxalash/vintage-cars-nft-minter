{"name":"McLaren F1","description":"The McLaren F1 announced the British supercar maker's foray into modern racing when it was unveiled in 1992. Six years later, it set the record for the world's fastest production car, at 242 mph. \"The McLaren F1 was Formula One legend Gordon Murray's high-tech supercar answer to Porsche and Ferrari,\" Hagerty says. \"And it didn't just exceed the standards they established, it obliterated them. Driving an F1 is a sublime ballet of shocking power, braking, and control.\" McLaren only built 64 of these, but fortunately, it just put up for sale chassis #69, the 60th model built.
