{"name":"Acura NSX","description":"Acura's halo car from 1990 to 2005, the NSX is young but mighty. \"While it's not as sexy as its European rivals, the Acura NSX showed the rest of the world that supercar specs and daily-driver manners could co-exist,\" Hagerty says. \"It inspires confidence and begs you to keep pushing, braking later, and turning harder. It may be the most underrated car on this list.\" Its successor, the new Acura NSX, reaches customers this year and is likely to inspire renewed interest in the original. Fortunately, Acura made 9,000 first-generation NSX cars so finding one online is easy.","image":"ipfs://QmYeB4Bxsarmt5X5PAoGtQvCYrHn4j9kTKw3Xtgfi7HWkV/Picture10.jpg"}
