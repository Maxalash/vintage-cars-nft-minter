{"name":"Dodge Viper GTS","description":"The V10 Dodge Viper GTS of the 1990s couldn't be built today. At 450 horsepower, it's every bit as raw as its predecessor, the Shelby Cobra, without anti-lock brakes or traction control to correct driver error. \"It's the automotive equivalent of whiskey, neatâ€“no pretense, just one hell of an experience,\" Hagerty says. You can find one online or through a collector vehicle auction house such as Auctions America or Mecum.","image":"ipfs://QmYeB4Bxsarmt5X5PAoGtQvCYrHn4j9kTKw3Xtgfi7HWkV/Picture15.jpg"}
