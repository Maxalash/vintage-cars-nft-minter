{"name":"Chevrolet Corvette","description":"The emblem of Big Three muscle cars, the Chevy Corvette is the most collected vehicle in America. The second generation, which spanned 1963 to 1967, is \"the most iconic American car ever made,\" says Keith Martin, publisher of Sports Car Market. \"It's still breathtaking and fresh today.\" Early generation Corvettes remain plentiful in the U.S., so you can scour auctions, collector car dealers, and websites like classiccars.com for deals.","image":"ipfs://QmYeB4Bxsarmt5X5PAoGtQvCYrHn4j9kTKw3Xtgfi7HWkV/Picture2.jpg"}
