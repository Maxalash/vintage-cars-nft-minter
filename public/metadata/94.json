{"name":"Porsche 356","description":"Porsche's first production car, the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive Porsche 356, survived four high-flying generations before it was laid to rest in the mid-1960s. Considered the most highly developed of the four-cylinder Porsches, the 356 is also regarded by vintage car experts as the most fun to drive. Procuring one isn't difficult: about half of the 76,000 cars originally produced survive.","image":"ipfs://QmYeB4Bxsarmt5X5PAoGtQvCYrHn4j9kTKw3Xtgfi7HWkV/Picture19.jpg"}
