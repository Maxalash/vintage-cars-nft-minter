{"name":"Chevrolet Camaro","description":"The original Camaro served as Chevrolet's answer to the Mustangâ€“but with more style and power. General Motors introduced the Camaro in 1967, setting off an eight-cylinder pony war of American muscle power that persists today. First-generation Camaros abound online. If you'd like to buy one, search sites like eBay or AutoTrader Classics.","image":"ipfs://QmYeB4Bxsarmt5X5PAoGtQvCYrHn4j9kTKw3Xtgfi7HWkV/Picture22.jpg"}
