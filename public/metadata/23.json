{"name":"Fiat 124 Spider","description":"The Pininfarina-designed Fiat 124 Spider debuted in the U.S. in 1968 to an eager audience. With ample trunk space and enough room in the cabin for two people not to touch shoulders, the roadster quickly became a road trip classic. \"It doesn't have much power, but it's cute,\" Martin says. \"It's a great summertime car.\" If you can't find an original model online, know that Fiat is introducing an updated 124 Spider for 2017.","image":"ipfs://QmYeB4Bxsarmt5X5PAoGtQvCYrHn4j9kTKw3Xtgfi7HWkV/Picture23.jpg"}
