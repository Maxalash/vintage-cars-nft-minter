{"name":"VW Beetle","description":"A counter-culture classic, the vintage VW Beetle represents simplicity and funâ€“in other words, motoring at its best. \"Besides the easy driving experience, the Beetle's friendly exterior attracts people no matter where you're driving, and it seems everyone has their own Beetle story to share,\" Hagerty says. \"This is not the car to buy if you're shy.\" If you'd like to get behind the wheel, old Beetles can easily be sourced from eBay and classified ads.","image":"ipfs://QmYeB4Bxsarmt5X5PAoGtQvCYrHn4j9kTKw3Xtgfi7HWkV/Picture13.jpg"}
