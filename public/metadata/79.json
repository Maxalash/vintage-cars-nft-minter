{"name":"Porsche 911","description":"The Porsche 911 represents vintage driving at its bestâ€”particularly during the golden era before the car's 1974 redesign. \"There's magic in the early 911,\" Hagerty says. \"It's an amazingly well-built machine that delivers one of the most honest driving experiences of any sports car ever built.\" Even by today's standards, first-generation 911s still have plenty of horsepower and can hold their own on the track. You can find one, even in mint condition, on eBay.","image":"ipfs://QmYeB4Bxsarmt5X5PAoGtQvCYrHn4j9kTKw3Xtgfi7HWkV/Picture4.jpg"}
