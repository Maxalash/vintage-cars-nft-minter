{"name":"DeTomaso Pantera","description":"With Italian styling and a reliable Ford V8 engine, the DeTomaso Pantera represents the best of both worlds and is a worthy alternative to similar Lamborghinis and Ferraris from the same era. \"You'd expect an early '70s Italian car to be garish, loud, and hard to drive,\" Hagerty says. \"While it is garish and loud, the Italian-bodied and American-powered Pantera is actually rather easy to drive.\" Procure one at a high-end classic car auction house, such as Barrett-Jackson or Bonhams.","image":"ipfs://QmYeB4Bxsarmt5X5PAoGtQvCYrHn4j9kTKw3Xtgfi7HWkV/Picture16.jpg"}
