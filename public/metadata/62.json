{"name":"Ford Model T","description":"Produced from 1908 to 1927, this is the car that birthed the American automotive industry. Affordable by mass market standards, the Model T begat car culture and road trips. \"Everyone needs to know where they came from,\" Hagerty says. \"When it comes to American motoring, that starting place is the Model T.\" With a volatile hand-crank engine and two-speed transmission (not including the reverse gear), the Model T isn't easy to drive, even if you can get your hands on one. But rest assuredâ€“27 mph will never feel so thrilling.","image":"ipfs://QmYeB4Bxsarmt5X5PAoGtQvCYrHn4j9kTKw3Xtgfi7HWkV/Picture12.jpg"}
