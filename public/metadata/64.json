{"name":"Volvo P1800","description":"The quirky Volvo P1800 was stylish enough for Roger Moore to drive one in the spy thriller TV series The Saint. This two-seater sports car is durable: one surviving model has clocked more than three million miles. Its brethren belong to private owners, but check with the Volvo Owners Clubs if you'd like to find one for sale or make an owner an offer.","image":"ipfs://QmYeB4Bxsarmt5X5PAoGtQvCYrHn4j9kTKw3Xtgfi7HWkV/Picture14.jpg"}
