{"name":"Austin-Healey 3000","description":"Introduced in 1959, the bulbous British roadster became the last of the \"big Healeys\" when it ended production in 1967. Curvaceous and brass, the Austin-Healey 3000 was an automotive icon of the Swinging Sixties. \"This was the final version of the 'Big Healey,' with its powerful six-cylinder engine and overdrive,\" Martin says. \"It will cruise easily at 75 mph on today's freeways.\" You can occasionally find a late-model Austin-Healey 3000 through Hemmings and other classic car-buying websites.","image":"ipfs://QmYeB4Bxsarmt5X5PAoGtQvCYrHn4j9kTKw3Xtgfi7HWkV/Picture24.jpg"}
